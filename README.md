# Week 4 MERN Stack Integration Assignment

## Project Overview
This project is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that demonstrates seamless integration between front-end and back-end components, including database operations, API communication, and state management.

## Tasks Summary
- **Project Setup**
  - Clear directory structure for client and server
  - MongoDB connection using Mongoose
  - Express.js server with middleware
  - React front-end using Vite with API proxy
  - Environment variables for configuration

- **Back-End Development**
  - RESTful API for blog application with endpoints for posts and categories
  - Mongoose models with relationships
  - Input validation and error handling middleware

- **Front-End Development**
  - React components for post list, single post, create/edit form, navigation
  - React Router for navigation
  - React hooks for state management
  - Custom hook for API calls

- **Integration and Data Flow**
  - API service in React communicating with back-end
  - State management for posts and categories
  - Forms with validation and optimistic UI updates
  - Loading and error state handling

- **Advanced Features**
  - User authentication (registration, login, protected routes)
  - Image uploads for blog post featured images
  - Pagination, searching, filtering
  - Comments feature for blog posts

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Node.js (v18+) and MongoDB are installed.
2. Clone the starter code repository.
3. Install server dependencies:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
4. Install client dependencies:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
5. Set up environment variables as described in the `.env.example` files.
6. Start the development servers:
   ```
   # In the server directory
   npm run dev

   # In the client directory
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
- Access the React front-end via the development server.
- Use the API endpoints to interact with the blog application.
